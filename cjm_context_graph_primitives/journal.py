"""The write-journal core: append-only JSONL ops — the durable, replayable source of truth.

The shared PRIMITIVE under every workflow journal (DEC ccbab9f5 point 1): a graph db is a
rebuildable PROJECTION; the non-re-derivable knowledge lives as an append-only log of write
ops. Domain layers own their op vocabularies and REPLAY (each registers its own verbs);
this module owns the discipline — append-on-success with exact-duplicate skip, read in
append order, session stamping for provenance.
